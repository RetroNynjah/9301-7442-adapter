# DM9301 to 74LS42 adapter
Use this simple adapter to replace obsolete and unobtainable DM9301 and N8252 BCD-to-decimal decoders with a regular 74LS42

I needed this adapter for repairing an old Atari arcade game so I thought I'd share the adapter.

Tested and working as a replacement for DM9301 but should work as a replacement for Signetics 8252 BCD-to-decimal decoders as well as those are direct replacements for the DM9301.
